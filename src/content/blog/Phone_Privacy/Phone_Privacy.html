<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
    Phones are one of the most vulnerable devices we carry around. Most likely, your phone is actually
    a glorified surveillance device that you carry around with you 24/7. It is essential that you 
    secure your phone if you want to maintain privacy on the internet, free of tracking.
</p>

<h2>Isn't stock android secure enough?</h2>
<p>
    If you update android on a regular basis, it may be secure enough, however, 
    <a href="../Privacy/Privacy.html">security is not privacy.</a> You can have a secure phone
    and still have your data leaked to the likes of google, facebook, or even amazon. Most likely,
    if you care about your privacy and you just want something that works, consider:
</p>

<h2>Apple</h2>
<p>
    Yes, it's one of the big corporations that can and will still collect your information.
    However, it is actually far less invasive than stock android phones made by samsung and other
    providers. They're also pretty serious about security too; however, the way they go about this
    isn't too ideal. Almost all their apps in their ecosystem still collect information about you,
    but they only send some of it, and only to Apple. The bad part about this is that many of the apps
    are closed source, so if you're a FOSS advocate like me, a better option is:
</p>
<h2>GrapheneOS</h2>
<p>
    In my opinion, 
    <a href="grapheneos.org">this</a>, 
    <a href="https://lineageos.org/">LineageOS</a>, and 
    <a href="https://calyxos.org/">CalyxOS</a> 
    are the only three ways you're going to get any privacy at all with phones. 
    Unfortuantely, if you're unknowledgeable with phones, the best thing you're going to get is an
    iphone, because i imagine that installing a custom ROM on an android phone would be pretty hard
    for those types of people.
</p>

<p>
    The OS that I use personally is GrapheneOS. If you install this operating system, you will have to
    remove google from your life forever, due to GAPPs not working with grapheneOS, so BE WARNED! 
    Removing google from your phone entirely is the only way to get privacy out of your phone, however,
    so if you do actually want true privacy, just keep that in mind.
</p>

<p>
    GrapheneOS is actually very usable, if you don't rely on google services. Its user interface is like
    that of stock android, and you can customize it very easily. Installing F-droid will provide you with
    a suite of free and open source applications. Speaking of applications:

<h2>Applications</h2>
<p>
    So you've got yourself a privacy and security hardened operating system. Now what?
</p>

<h3>Newpipe</h3>
<p>
    Tired of going on the web version of youtube and getting tracked on their website? Newpipe is a 
    heavily underrated application that allows you to browse youtube, without the frontend tracking and
    fingerprinting. Note that youtube still has your ip and browsing habits when you use newpipe, so be 
    sure to spoof your ip using either a trusted vpn, or your own trust free vpn. This app allows you
    to see and download videos, and although the comments break sometimes, it can still on occassion display
    them properly. I use this app as my main youtube frontend.
</p>
<h3>andOTP</h3>
<p>
    Tired of using google authentication for all of your two factor authentication accounts? AndOTP
    is an open source implementation of two factor authentication, and can store accounts and generate
    new authentication codes. These apps can be found in F-droid.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
    Phones are not designed for privacy, security, or anonimity. They are designed to track you, and in order
    to stop that tracking completely, you need to step outside of your comfort zone and basically get rid
    of google. If you're not willing to do this, just get an IPhone or something.
