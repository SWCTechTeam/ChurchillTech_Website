<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    Privacy is one of those things that people pretend to care about until they open up google,
    youtube, facebook, or any other company that infringes on your rights. It is actually important,
    however, because it allows us to act independently of governing forces, and it empowers people to 
    speak freely.
</p>
<p>
    Privacy isn't just about making yourself completely unknown on the internet. It's about creating
    and separating different identities from each other. For instance, I have a website here which 
    is associated with my name, but i have separate accounts for my social media which are under another
    alias.
</p>
<p>
    Privacy also isn't security. Security can help you achieve privacy, and the two can overlap, but these
    two terms are different. For instance, Apple makes very secure products in that they are very hard to
    crack, but they are not private in the sense that they still collect information about you.
</p>
<h2>What can I do about my privacy?</h2>
<p>
    This is a good question. In my opinion, the first thing that one should do to increase the amount of 
    privacy in their lives is to switch search engines or web browsers to something other than google chrome
    or google search. There are many good replacements for these. <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">Duckduckgo</a>
    is a search engine that is more private than google, but my recommendation is 
    <a href="https://searx.bar">searx</a>. This is because this is the only open source search engine, so you know
    for sure what is going on in the backend. You can even host your own searx server.
</p>
<p>
    For the browser, I recommend <a href="https://brave.com">brave</a>. This is a browser that can randomize
    your fingerprint, and is completely free and open source.
</p>
<h3>Browser Fingerprinting</h3>
<p>
    Tracking ip addresses and using cookies are very old school methods for collecting data nowadays.
    Many companies now employ the technique known as fingerprinting, which is a method by which 
    they can look at the extensions you have installed on your browser, look at what browser 
    you are using, the settings,and come up with a unique 
    identifier based on those categories. Brave randomizes your fingerprint so each new session will look
    completely different, thus mitigating your threat to tracking.
</p>
<h3>Signal</h3>
<p>
    The next thing I'd consider to be the biggest privacy threat would be unencrypted communications. 
    <a href="https://signal.org/en/">Signal</a> is one of the best encrypted messengers, and the one
    I use for personal communications. This is almost as fast as SMS, and it looks just as good. I do
    use XMPP, but that's a protocol that I might write a future article about. Also, signal is better
    for non-advanced users.
</p>
<h3>VPNs</h3>
<p>
    VPNs are good for watching banned videos and torrenting things over the web, but vpns do not contribute
    much to your privacy. Your VPN provider can still see as much as your ISP used to be able to, so if 
    you don't trust your VPN provider, you're better off just saving those dollars and using them to do anything
    else. That being said, you can still be identified by your ip when you go online, so how do you prevent this?
</p>
<h3>Making your own VPN</h3>
<p>
    The process of doing this is actually easier than it sounds. 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxpX_mubz2A">Wolfgang made a good video on this</a>, 
    so if you're interested in this, I suggest watching that video. Yes, it's on youtube, but I actually
    don't know if he has a peertube or a lbry channel.
</p>
<h2>So I've done that. What next?</h2>
<p>
    The things in this section are significantly harder to do than the things I talked about in the last
    section. If you're not willing to do these things, then at least do the things outlined above. 
</p>
<h3>Using TOR</h3>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">TOR</a> is a free and open source 
    project that basically completely anonymizes you on the internet.
    They combat fingerprinting by making every tor browser the same, making it impossible to tell
    the end user apart from other users. I use TOR for sensitive searches along with searching up
    things I want to buy.
</p>
<h3>Linux and FOSS</h3>
<p>
    The last thing I suggest doing is switching to free and open source software whenever possible.
    This includes the operating system you use. This may be a big shift in your life, but I guarantee
    that it's worth it. Free and open source projects are often time multiple times better than closed
    source project you have to pay for. I guarantee that if you don't try out free and open source software,
    you're missing out. Also, it might seem like on the surface that you might be wasting your time by
    "making your life harder" using linux, but I assure you, linux is very easy. The installation process
    is easier than windows, at least for <a href="https://manjaro.org/">manjaro</a>, specifically
    manjaro xfce, the distribution of linux that I recommend for beginners. For those that 
    don't know, linux has many distributions, whichare all linux but are all slightly different. 
    They may come with different programs installed by default, or they may use a modified 
    version of the linux kernel.
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    I recommend that every person who values democracy at least do some of the things mentioned in this
    article. If you're still reluctant to do some of the things here, I'll ask you this: if everyone
    else is waiting for someone else to protect liberty, and nobody does anything, is it really okay?
</p>
<p>
    The truth is, at some point, we either take action to prevent our own government and businesses from
    undermining our liberty, or they take it away from us and it becomes much harder to fight, and we live
    in a world governed by fear. Better sooner than later, in my opinion.
