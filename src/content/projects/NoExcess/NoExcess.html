            <p>A barebones, compiled, statically typed programming language that nobody uses and nobody asked for.</p>
            <p>
                Have you ever programmed in c and thought, "wow, this is legit just so much pain I cannot even live anymore"? Introducing a language
                that's just as bad, or worse. Welcome to my own frankenstein creation that is NoExcess. There's no excess syntax because I'm lazy.
                Go ahead! Try it yourself in like 2 years when it actually becomes functional, or never because i would be too lazy to finish the project.
            </p>

            <h3>Actual technical information (For people who care)</h3>
            <p>
                NoExcess is a very minimal language that I plan to keep close to bare metal. It will compile to C at first, but I'll try to get it to compile
                to assembly eventually. Basically, the syntax is supposed to be designed to be much more intuitive compared to c. All variables are static by
                default and pointer syntax is much less confusing (in my opinion). Although this will never become a working programming language, I wanted too
                try to make one to see what the process was like.
            </p>

            <h3>The Lexer</h3>
            <p>
                As of today, it's the only component that i've done, but basically this is supposed to be the easy part. It wasn't too hard, but it takes sort of
                long to write. Writing the parser should be much more time consuming, however.
