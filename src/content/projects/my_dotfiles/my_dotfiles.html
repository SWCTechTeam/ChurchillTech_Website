            <h2>Specifications</h2>
            <p>
                I made these dotfiles on arch linux, with a 1920x1080 monitor. Additionally, you will need to install the programs
                listed in the dwm keybindings section in config.h, and the programs which correspond to the dotfiles.
            </p>
            <h2>Minimalism</h2>
            <p>
                My dotfiles use what I consider to be minimal software; that is to say, software that does not take excess up extra
                resources or memory on a computer. In a world where computers are supposed to be faster, programs with fancy guis end 
                up making them run slower. The end result is that people feel as though they need better and better hardware, for things
                that they could do a decade ago for the same speed. This is why I use linux, and specifically use minimal programs for my
                dotfiles.
            </p>
            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>
                Some people think minimal software can't look good. This is a very wrong assumption. In my opionion, Linux can often times look
                much better than windows and macos, and can give the user more freedom for customization in many things including the ui design.
                Personally, I would make a set of dotfiles that work for you, and then reuse them whenever you reinstall linux or get a new computer.
                This is because it can be confusing to use someone else's dotfiles, and you may not like their colors or customizations.
            </p>
            <h2>Effort</h2>
            <p>
                Designing my set of dotfiles took countless hours, although it would have been more had I not built it on distrotube's dotfiles.
                If you like what you see, go try mine out! You're free to modify anything.
