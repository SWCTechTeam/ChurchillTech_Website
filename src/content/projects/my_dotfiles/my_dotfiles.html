<h2>Specifications</h2>
<p>
  I made these dotfiles on arch linux, with a 1920x1080 monitor. Additionally,
  you will need to install the programs listed in the dwm keybindings section in
  config.h, and the programs which correspond to the dotfiles.
</p>
<h2>Minimalism</h2>
<p>
  My dotfiles use what I consider to be minimal software; that is to say,
  software that does not take excess up extra resources or memory on a computer.
  In a world where computers are supposed to be faster, programs with fancy guis
  end up making them run slower. The end result is that people feel as though
  they need better and better hardware, for things that they could do a decade
  ago for the same speed. This is why I use linux, and specifically use minimal
  programs for my dotfiles.
</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>
  Some people think minimal software can't look good. This is a very wrong
  assumption. In my opionion, Linux can often times look much better than
  windows and macos, and can give the user more freedom for customization in
  many things including the ui design. Personally, I would make a set of
  dotfiles that work for you, and then reuse them whenever you reinstall linux
  or get a new computer. This is because it can be confusing to use someone
  else's dotfiles, and you may not like their colors or customizations.
</p>
<h2>Effort</h2>
<p>
  Designing my set of dotfiles took countless hours, although it would have been
  more had I not built it on distrotube's dotfiles. If you like what you see, go
  try mine out! You're free to modify anything.
