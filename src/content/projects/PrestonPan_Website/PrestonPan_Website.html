<h2>About This Website</h2>
<p>
    This website was designed specifically according to the <a href="https://draculatheme.com">dracula</a>
    color scheme because it's the one I use for my <a href="../My_Dotfiles/My_Dotfiles.html">dotfiles.</a>
</p>

<h2>Minimal</h2>
<p>
    This website was designed to be as minimal as possible, to be easy to read. I chose Jetbrains mono for
    the font because it's very easy on the eyes and is monospaced for increased readability. There are no
    ads, trackers, or javascript that can track you on this website. Every part of this website is completely
    free and open source, including the frontend, the font, static site generator which I made myself, 
    server and even the operating system of the server which is just nginx running on linux.
</p>
<p>
    On slow internet connections, and even on fast ones, you will notice that this website loads faster than
    most others due to its minimal nature. Other blog websites are bloated and unusable in some cases.
