<h1>My Dotfiles</h1>
<p>
    So, these are my gruvbox Dotfiles. The dotfile repository is unfinished at
    the moment because I accedentally deleted my home directory the other day,
    but you can still look at some of the images.
</p>
<p>
    My dotfiles are currently running on trisquel GNU+Linux and they are currently
    being reproduced. However, if you want the current version, you can clone the repo.
    When I finish, I will update this post.
