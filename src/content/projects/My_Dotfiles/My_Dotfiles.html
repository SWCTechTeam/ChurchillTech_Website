<h2>My Dotfiles</h2>
<p>
    So, these are my gruvbox Dotfiles. The dotfile repository is unfinished at
    the moment because I accedentally deleted my home directory the other day,
    but you can still look at some of the images.
</p>
<p>
    My dotfiles are currently running on trisquel GNU+Linux and they are currently
    being reproduced. However, if you want the current version, you can clone the repo.
    When I finish, I will update this post.

<h2>Update</h2>
<p>
    My new dotfiles have been pushed onto github! They look pretty similar to the old one,
    but unfortunately, I could not find the wallpaper. My emacs config requires you to manually
    install everything I require instead of use-package. Also, it uses the default emacs keybindings,
    which are better than the evil mode keybindings (hot take, I know, especially since some people think
    default emacs keybindings will give you "emacs pinky". Who knows, maybe they're correct).
