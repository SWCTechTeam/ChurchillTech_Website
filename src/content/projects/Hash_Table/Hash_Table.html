<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    This, so far, is my hash table implementation in java. I started making it
    because I have I try to use my code instead of other peoples' code whenever I
    can. Currently there is only a java implementation utilizing
    linked lists, however an implementation that utilizes a binary search tree and
    one that is programmed in c is coming soon. Also, the hashing algorithm
    will be replaced with salsa20's hash function, or perhaps another one if needed
    (email me or send me a message through matrix for good hashing algorithms. They
    do not need to be cryptographically secure).

<h2>Details</h2>
<p>
    The process of making a hash table is pretty simple in java, I found. Basically,
    classes and lack of memory allocation make this much easier to debug and to program
    than in c. However, because I do recognize that it can be slower, and that c is in need
    of hash table implementations way more than java, I will program a version of this code in c.
    Another thing is that this hash table cannot hold so many entries due to its primitive hash function,
    and it is slow at handling them due to the nature of linked lists. Another problem is that
    both the key and the value are strings, which limits the flexibility of this implementation.
    To solve this in java, I will use generic types, and for c, I will use void pointers.

<p>
    Basically, the current implementation works by setting a max size, and then allocating memory to buckets equal
    to that max size. A bucket is a section that holds a key value pair. Each bucket is actually a linked list, and
    each node contains a key value pair that hashes to the index of the bucket. This can be used to solve collision,
    because if there is already an entry in a bucket the hash table makes a new node in the bucket and places the new
    pair in that node. Deletion works the same way; simply hash the key, go to the bucket that matches the hash, then
    find the node that has the key inside.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    Overall, this was pretty educational, and I will implement more data structures and algorithms in the future.
