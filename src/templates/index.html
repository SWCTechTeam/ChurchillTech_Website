        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Preston Pan, a student at Sir Winston Churchill
          Secondary. Here is a little bit about myself:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>good at C and python, depending on who you ask</li>
          <li>terrible css/webdev skills as you can tell by this website</li>
          <li>learning linear algebra and cryptography</li>
          <li>experimenting with x86-64 NASM assembly</li>
          <li>
            day to day user and advocate of free software
          </li>
          <li>fun fact: I'm actually really bad at everything above</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Of course, a few bullet points wouldn't do anyone justice if they
          actually wanted to describe themselves, but I hope this gives you, the
          reader, a rough idea.

        <h2>Contact Me</h2>
        <p>
          I only use platforms that respect my privacy. Therefore, I do not have
            an active discord account or social media. Ideally, I would not have a gitlab
	    but I have to let people know about my projects somehow. You can, however, clone
	    the repos from my git server.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>My Email: PrestonPan@prestonpan.tech</li>
          <li>My XMPP address: prestonpan@jabber.calyxinstitute.org</li>
          <li>
            My Gitlab:
            <a href="https://gitlab.com/PrestonPan"
              >https://gitlab.com/PrestonPan</a
            >

          <h2>About this site</h2>
          <p>
            This site was designed to be minimal, with less than 120 lines of css, and no javascript.
            To avoid using javascript, I used a static site generator that I wrote specifically
            for this website. 
          </p>
          <p>
            If you like that this website has no hidden trackers, google fonts,
            or really anything that could undermine your privacy, or frankly, your eyes, consider:

        <h2>Donating</h2>
        <p>
          All my code is free/libre because I believe in a free and
          private internet. If you like any one of the projects I put out and
          license for free, consider supporting me by donating the following
          cryptocurrencies:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            My monero address (anonymous, secure, private):
