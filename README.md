# My Website
I decided to make a website because I always thought that web development was super frustrating.
Turns out, it still is, and I'm really bad at making websites. Let's just call it minimal.

Jokes aside, the website is actually designed to be as minimal as possible. With less than 70 lines of css,
the use of a self made static site generator instead of frontend javascript, and with nginx as its server, 
each page can load within less than a second. No ads, trackers, javascript bloat,
or other nasties.

Due to the minimalistic nature of the website, fonts will be locally stored and there will be no google fonts
to render.

Link to the website will be https://prestonpan.tech.
